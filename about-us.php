        <h4>History of <span class="heading-white">Bubble Tea</span></h4>
        <div class="container">
            <p class="historyText">
                The history of bubble tea traces back to Taiwan in the 1980s. It was initially known as "pearl milk tea"
                or "boba milk tea," named after the tapioca pearls (boba) that are a key component of the drink. The
                exact origins of bubble tea are somewhat debated, but it is widely believed to have been invented by a
                small tea stand in Taichung, Taiwan.The concept of adding tapioca pearls to tea was inspired by
                Taiwanese dessert shops that served sweetened tapioca pearls in various desserts. The innovation of
                incorporating these chewy pearls into a beverage created a unique and enjoyable experience. Initially,
                bubble tea was made by combining black tea, milk, sugar, and tapioca pearls. The mixture was shaken
                vigorously to create a frothy and bubbly texture, hence the name "bubble tea."Bubble tea gained
                popularity in Taiwan and quickly spread to other Asian countries. It eventually made its way to North
                America and gained a significant following, particularly in cities with large Asian communities. The
                drink's popularity surged as bubble tea shops introduced a variety of flavors, including fruit-infused
                teas, creamy milk teas, and innovative combinations.Over time, bubble tea has evolved into a
                customizable beverage with numerous variations. Customers can choose their tea base (such as black tea,
                green tea, or herbal tea), sweetness level, and toppings, which can include tapioca pearls, fruit
                jellies, popping boba, and more. Bubble tea has become a beloved and iconic drink around the world,
                cherished for its unique textures, refreshing flavors, and the sheer joy it brings to tea lovers of all
                ages.Today, bubble tea continues to evolve with new flavors, techniques, and creative presentations. It
                has become a symbol of cultural fusion, offering a delightful blend of Eastern and Western influences.
                Bubble tea shops have become social hubs, where friends gather to enjoy their favorite drinks, and
                enthusiasts explore the latest trends in the ever-growing world of bubble tea.
